# Hi, I'm Amy :watermelon:

I'm a junior studying Computer Science at UCLA!

If I'm not coding, I'm probably playing volleyball or listening to Korean R&B!
Check out what I'm currently listening to :notes:

<table style="border-spacing:15px;border:0px">
    <tr>
        <td>
            <a href=https://open.spotify.com/track/6j7hih15xG2cdYwIJnQXsq>

            </a>
        </td>
        <td>
            <p>Not Over You</p>
            <p>Gavin DeGraw</p>
        </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
